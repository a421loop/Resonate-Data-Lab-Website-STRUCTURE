# Your Life in Sound: Listening with Your Ears and with Technology 
This course explores digital audio as an untapped, personal, everyday data source that we can use to examine our relationships to other people, our environments, and our technologies. Through listening, we can know things that we cannot know by seeing, or touching, or tasting. Sonic thinking, which philosopher Bernd Herzogenrath describes as the practice of, "thinking with and by means of sound, not a thinking about sound" is a capacity that people innately have, but can improve with practice. Students will practice sonic thinking as well as listening-with their own ears and with technology-as a form of inquiry. Through in-class and out-of-class activities, students will: digitally capture sounds from daily life, use these captured sounds to create new sound designs, and use audio data science techniques to understand the sounds. We will also discuss the role of sound in various aspects of life, how technology has changed our relationship to sound, personal archival and data collection practices, our attitudes toward ubiquitous computing technologies, and the ethics of data access and governance. This class is part of a multi-year research project exploring how personal sonic archives might encourage people to develop new sonic and data literacies that can help them think critically about the role of data and technology in their lives. Students will have the option of donating their coursework to the ongoing research project and contributing to the project as participant-researchers.
