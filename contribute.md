# Contribute a Moment of Sound

The **Resonate Data Lab Sound Archive** collects meaningful, beautiful, or memorable sounds from everyday life. Anyone can donate a moment of sound and share the story behind it.


## How It Works

1. **Choose a Moment and Record it**  
   Find a sound that matters to you. It could be anything—a creaking swing, birds in a park, footsteps, a favorite snack being eaten, or a quiet moment at home.  

2. **Reflect on it**  
   Use a few sentences to answer:  
   - What are we hearing?  
   - Where and when was it recorded?  
   - Why does it matter to you?  
   - Any emotions, memories, or thoughts attached?  

3. **Submit Your Contribution**  
   Include:  
   - An audio file (MP3/WAV)  
   - Your description  
   - Your name or initials (optional)  
   - Optional: permission for others to remix it  



## Why Contribute?

Archiving sounds helps us:  
- Remember small, meaningful moments  
- Share experiences with others  
- Create a public sonic memory for the Resonate Data Lab community  

IDEA FOR LATERR Every donated sound may appear in the **landing page randomiser**, letting visitors experience the archive one moment at a time.
