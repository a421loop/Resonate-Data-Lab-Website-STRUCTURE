Exploring Language Through a Generative Mood Tracker

How do we translate the intangible experience of mood into something we can hear and reflect upon? This generative mood tracking app attempts to discover the sonic representability of emotional language—the extent to which abstract feelings can be heard—exploring how certain concepts can be better, or worse, sonically represented than others. Why does "rain" sounds so distinctly through AI generation while "solitude" remains acoustically elusive? This tension between the sonically obvious and the sonically obscure reveals the hidden hierarchies within our emotional vocabularies.

The app invites users to log their momentary mood once per day within a randomly generated one-hour window, documenting their emotional state through structured prompts designed for sonic generation. Their written reflections are transformed into AI-generated sounds using various musical and ambient labels, but these sounds remain unheard until the next day's entry is complete. This gap in time allows the generated sound to be encountered fresh, without the pressure of matching preconceived sonic expectations.
