# Why a sound manifesto 
[ask the team abt this]
It’s our hope that this lab will help people recognize sound as more than secondary/supporting medium. We see sound as a form of memory, intelligence, and connection. 
Without sound, we would lose the voices, pulses, and atmospheres that carry culture, identity, and care across time. Just as archives preserve traces of the past, sonic archives preserve how it felt to live in a moment: the breath before a word, the hum of a machine, the resonance of a shared space.

## Catelyn's sound manifesto
- Sound acts as reassurance for interaction.
- Sound can be a means for expression (you in the present), understanding/awareness (of your surroundings), reflection (you in the past), and communication (you with others).
- Sound reflects embodied space and time.
- Sound can keep you present.
- Sound acknowledges matter.
- Sound shapes individuals/individuality
- Everyone has different experiences (past and present) with sound
- Sound is contradictory/multifaceted (ugly and beautiful, loud and quiet, sharp and soft, new and expected)

- Sound is always there, whether you are listening to it or not.
