# Resonate Data Lab Sound Manifesto

## Deo
- Sound is an extension of a body. It's an extension of how we as a people interact, reflect, and live.
- Sound is that element that always knows what to say when we don't.
- Sound is what makes things visible
- Sound is a friend, adventure guide, and teacher
- Sound is empowering
- Sound comforting
- Some embraces, pushes, and fights with you
- Sound never walks out, always present
- Sound is gentle, cruel, big
- Sound holds, it pours, and connects
- Sound is a witness to time

## Catelyn's Sound Manifesto
- Sound acts as reassurance for interaction.
- Sound can be a means for expression (you in the present), understanding/awareness (of your surroundings), reflection (you in the past), and communication (you with others).
- Sound reflects embodied space and time.
- Sound can keep you present.
- Sound acknowledges matter.
- Sound shapes individuals/individuality.
- Everyone has different experiences (past and present) with sound.
- Sound is contradictory/multifaceted (ugly and beautiful, loud and quiet, sharp and soft, new and expected).

## Sarena's Sound is

- Sound is intimate.
- Sound is layered storytelling with different layers prominent or not for different listeners.
- Sound is as ever present as everyday life.

## Jordan's Sound Manifesto
- Sound is vibrations in matter...that connect that matter together.
- Sound is a medium for making: making meaning, making connections, making the familiar strange and the strange familiar.
- Sound is something you can tune into (or tune out of).
- Sound is always there, whether you are listening to it or not.
- Sound is now: Sound is happening in this moment.
- Sound is in all directions at once. Sound also moves through you.
- (You can capture sound, sort of, but not the experience of listening?)
- Sound is a gulf and direct contact, at the same time.
- Sound invites us to wonder.
- Sound is always in flux. Sound is motion.

- Sound is a medium for spoken language.
- Sound is memories.
- Sound is warning.
